Package Overview
================

Intervene is a (python) package for creating, inferring and evaluating causal models based on tabular or relational data.
It aims to provide a high-level set of commands for running common tasks in a user-friendly way.
However, the underlying operations are exposed so that if low-level operations are required, then they can be used
directly by an "advanced user".
Our goal is to provide the most reliable system for causal modelling so that a user may make decisions with **confidence**.

The three main capabilities of Intervene are:

1. Create data based on a ground truth causal model.
2. Infer the structure of a causal model based on provided data.
3. Analyze and evaluate a given causal structure based on the underlying data.


Creating Data
-------------

Trusting a model is difficult.
Particularly with Causal models where the ground truth is (most likely) unknown.
To help alleviate some of this uncertainty we provide the capability for a use to generate data with similar
properties to the data they are trying to draw conclusions about.
Armed with this synthetic data, a user can determine how well the model performs on data similar to their own through a
suite of performance metrics.


Inferring Causal Structure
--------------------------

Being able to determine cause and effect from data is the main goal of Intervene.
We use a state-of-the-art modelling system to give insights into data.


Analyzing and Evaluating
------------------------

The potential of Causal modelling is realised when we start to ask **Counterfactual** questions of the data.
A well-calibrated causal model allows the user to mimic random trials which otherwise would not be possible in the real world.
