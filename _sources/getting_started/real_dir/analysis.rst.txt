Sensitivity Analysis
--------------------

Sensitivity analysis is a technique used to eveluate how much changing one variable will affect another variable.
It allows us to estimate the *sensitivity* of one variable with respect to another. 

Typically in Bayesian networks, sensitivity analysis is used to *refute* estimates: If an estimate is unstable, how can it be trusted?

In intervene, we currently only have **one** type of sensitivity analysis. This analysis measures how susceptible an estimate
is to breaches in the causal sufficiency (or causal Markov) assumption.

Sensitivity to Latent Confounders
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. role:: bash(code)
   :language: bash

In order to measure the sensitivity of an intervention to latent confunders we prefom an 'experiment' - we introduce many different latent confounders and examine how they affect the intervention. If any of introduced confounders change the result of the intervention (i.e. *flip* the odds ratio), the intervention is
perceived to be unstable with respect to this confounder.

Running the analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to activate this functionality in intervene, the :bash:`--measure-sensitivity` needs to be set to True.

For example:
:bash:`intervene real --data /folder/data.csv --interventions folder/interventions.yml --measure-sensitivity True`

The sensitivity analysis will be run on any interventions which have been specified in the *interventions.yml*

Interpreting the results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the example below, we are performing the intervention GH -> VD and trying to determine where having a confounder
would be *high risk* for this particular intervention.

   :scale: 40 %

   Example DAG

The analysis produces a plot with colour coded confounders. The confounders all have the prefix *H_*.

.. figure:: images/danger_plot_GH_VD.png
   :scale: 40 %

   Danger plot for GH -> VD

The confounders scale from Green -> Red, representing low risk -> high risk. In this example, the highest risk node would be H_8.
In the case that a high risk confounder had been found, the next step would be to consult an expert to ascertain the likihood of a confounder being in the proposed location.
