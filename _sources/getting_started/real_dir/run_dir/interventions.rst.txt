Performing Interventions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. role:: bash(code)
   :language: bash

As suggested by the name, the primary purpose of the intervene toolbox is to perform *interventions*.
We can intervene on a treatment variable of interest to set a specified level, with the view of observing the effect on some outcome variable.
In this manner we can determine what the effect of this particular intervention is.

Specifically, interventions are presented as odds ratios, the odds of an outcome given treatment, vs the outcome given
control.

.. math::

    \frac{\frac{P(\text{outcome} = \text{target} | \text{intervention = target})}{P(\text{outcome} = \text{target} | \text{intervention = reference})}}{\frac{P(\text{outcome} = \text{reference} | \text{intervention = target})}{P(\text{outcome} = \text{reference} | \text{intervention = reference})}}

Running an Intervention
++++++++++++++++++++++++
In order to run an intervention, the user must specify the :bash:`--intervention` flag in the CLI. Here, a path to an
intervention file must be given.

An example command could be:

:bash:`intervene real --data /my/data/folder --output my/data/output/folder --intervention my/folder/intervention_config.yml`

Where we have specified the usage of the *real* component, and set the intervention flag to *my/folder/intervention_config.yml*.

Constructing the Intervention YAML
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To create an intervention yaml, 6 things are necessary:

- The outcome variable
- The outcome variable's reference level
- A *list* of the outcome variable's target levels
- A *list* of the intervention variables, along with:
    - A *list* intervention variable's targets
    - The intervention variable's reference level

The intervention file should then be specified in the following fashion:

.. code-block:: yaml

    target: spontaneous_combustion
    outcome_reference_level: not_on_fire
    outcome_target_levels: ['on_fire', 'a_little_toasty']
    interventions:
    - variable: semtex_for_breakfast
      reference_level: no
      target_levels: ['yes', 'just a bite']
    - variable: drank_petrol
      reference_level: no
      target_levels: ['yes']
