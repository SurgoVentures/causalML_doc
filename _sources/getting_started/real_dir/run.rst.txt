Running on Real Data
--------------------

Just as for synthetic data, a predefined pipeline for real data can be run using the CLI and
and is configurable by a range of command-line options.
The command for running the real-pipeline is
::

    intervene real

followed by the desired option and their values. Since for real-data we do not have access to a
ground-truth, there is no evaluative aspect as there is for the synthetic pipeline. What the real-pipeline
does allow for that its counterpart does not, however, is the performing of interventions which is
of course one of the primary motivations for causal-modelling in the first place. Given a graph
consisting of variables causal relations, we can predict the result of intervening, according to Pearl's do-calculus,
on a variable or set of variables with respect to some target variable.

In the following sections, we first give a sketch of the make-up of the real-pipeline before diving
deeper into those components that require additional explanation to configure, use or interpret.
