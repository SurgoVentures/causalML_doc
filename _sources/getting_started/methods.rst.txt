Algorithms
============

This section will provide an overview of the algorithms used within the intervene library. There are broadly two
categories of algorithm employed: **structural estimation**, and **parameter estimation**. First, a structure learning
algorithm must be used to estimate the (CP)DAG. Following this a parameter estimation method must be used to infer the
parameters -- forming a Bayesian network.
