Creating a pipeline component.
--------------------------------

In order to add functionality to the pipeline framework, it must be wrapped in a function decorated with the ``@pipelinemethod`` decorator. For example, replacing the structure learning algorithm with a function ``SL_algorithm`` such that it can be used within a pipeline;


.. literalinclude:: component_example.py
    :linenos:
    :language: python

This ``run_new_method`` pipeline method could then be used in a custom pipeline.
