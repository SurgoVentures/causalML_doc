Welcome to Intervene's documentation!
=====================================

Intervene is a python package for building, training and evaluating Causal Models.

We provide 3 main capabilities:
    - Generating Synthetic Models and the corresponding Data that the model produces.
    - Learning a Network that represents the data.
    - Being able to run evaluation pipelines over a learned network given the dataset that was used to produce it.

In this document we go into much more detail about each of these capabilities.

We envision this document as a reference text, the best way to learn about Intervene is to use it.

So, have fun, and if you have any questions, or would like any clarifications, please reach out to us.
We'll do our best to help.
